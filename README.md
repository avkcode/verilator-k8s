# Verilator on Kubernetes (k8s)

## Legacy Meets Modernization

Companies operating in the semiconductor industry often rely on a "legacy" technology stack â€” typically CentOS 6 or 7 with outdated package bases, aging infrastructure, and workflows dating back to the mid-2000s. In this space, every mistake can cost millions, so risk aversion is the norm. However, that doesnâ€™t mean modernization should be ignored. Sooner or later, contemporary infrastructure practices and SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) approaches will find their way into even the most conservative environments.

## Why Run Verilator on Kubernetes?

Running **Verilator** on **Kubernetes (k8s)** provides a **scalable**, **automated**, and **reproducible** approach to hardware simulation and verification.

### Benefits:
- **Parallel Execution**: Distribute simulations across multiple nodes to speed up regression testing.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically allocate compute resources based on job demand.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Recover from failures without manual intervention.
- **DevOps Integration**: Seamless alignment with CI/CD pipelines.
- **Reproducible Environments**: Use containers to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production stages.
- **Collaboration**: Bridging the gap between hardware and software teams with modern infrastructure.

Verilator converts Verilog/SystemVerilog into C++/SystemC models, and k8s ensures those simulations are executed efficiently and reliably.

Packaging with nfpm

nfpm is a simple tool to create Linux packages like .deb (Debian/Ubuntu) and .rpm (CentOS/Fedora). Instead of manually managing package creation with complex scripts, nfpm lets you define your package metadata and contents in a YAML file.

This is ideal for developers who want to distribute their applications easily across Linux systems without diving deep into low-level packaging tools.

Create nfpm.yaml configuration:
```yaml
name: verilator
arch: amd64
platform: linux
version: 5.035
section: devel
priority: optional
maintainer: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
description: |
  Verilator is a fast, free Verilog HDL simulator.
  It converts Verilog to a cycle-accurate behavioral model in C++ or SystemC.
  Verilator is not a traditional simulator, but a compiler.
vendor: Verilator Project

contents:
  - src: bin/verilator
    dst: /usr/bin/verilator

depends:
  - g++
  - make
  - perl
  - libfl2
  - libfl-dev
  - zlib1g
  - zlib1g-dev

conflicts:

```

Build the package:
```
nfpm package --config nfpm.yaml --packager deb --target .
```

Install the package:
```
apt-get install ./verilator_5.035_amd64.deb
```

## Build & Push the Docker Image

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t verilator-k8s:latest .
   ```

2. **Run a local Docker registry:**
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2
   ```

3. **Tag the image for the local registry:**
   ```bash
   docker tag verilator-k8s:latest localhost:5000/verilator-k8s:latest
   ```

4. **Push the image:**
   ```bash
   docker push localhost:5000/verilator-k8s:latest
   ```

## Deploy to Kubernetes

1. **Deploy using a Kubernetes manifest:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```

2. **Check deployment status:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get all
   ```

   Example output:
   ```
   NAME                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   pod/verilator-deployment-64cd8fdc55-6v724   1/1     Running   0          108s
   pod/verilator-deployment-64cd8fdc55-cjznw   1/1     Running   0          108s
   ...

   NAME                                   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   deployment.apps/verilator-deployment   5/5     5            5           108s

   NAME                                              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
   replicaset.apps/verilator-deployment-64cd8fdc55   5         5         5       108s
   ```

## ðŸ“„ View Verilator Logs

1. **Check logs from a specific pod:**
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -f pod/verilator-deployment-64cd8fdc55-zfpdz
   ```

2. **Example log output:**
   ```
